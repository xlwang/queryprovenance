\section{Modeling abstractions}
\label{sec:abstractions}

In this section, we introduce a running example inspired from the use-case of
Example~\ref{ex:taxes}, and describe the model abstractions that we use to
formalize the diagnosis problem.



\input{content/example}

\begin{example}\label{ex:taxes2}
    
Figure~\ref{fig:example} demonstrates an example tax bracket adjustment in the
spirit of Example~\ref{ex:taxes}. The adjustment sets the tax rate to 30\% for
income levels above \$87,500, and is implemented by query $q_1$. A digit
transposition mistake in the query, results in an incorrect tax rate for tuple
$t_3$. Query $q_2$ that calculates the amount owed based on the corresponding
tax rate and income propagates the error to other fields. The mistake is
further obscured by query $q_3$, which inserts a tuple with slightly higher
income than $t_3$ and the correct (lower) tax rate.

\end{example}
% 
While traditional data cleaning techniques seek to identify and correct the
erroneous values in the table \emph{Taxes} directly, our goal is to diagnose
the problem, and understand the reasons for these errors. In this case, the
reason for the data errors is the incorrect predicate value in query $q_1$.

In this paper, we assume that we know \emph{some} errors in the dataset, and
that these errors were caused by erroneous updates. The errors may be
obtained in different ways: traditional data cleaning tools may identify
discrepancies in the data (e.g., a tuple with lower income has higher tax
rate), or errors can be reported directly from users (e.g., customers
reporting discrepancies to customer service). \emph{Our goal is not to correct
the errors directly, but to analyze them as a ``symptom'' and provide a
diagnosis.} The diagnosis can produce a targeted treatment: knowing how the
errors were introduced guides the proper way to trace and resolve them.

\subsection{Error modeling}
\label{sec:model}

In our setting, the diagnoses are associated with errors in the queries that
operated on the data. In Example~\ref{ex:taxes2}, the errors in the dataset
are due to the digit transposition mistake in the WHERE clause predicate of
query $q_1$. Our goal is to infer the errors in a log of queries
automatically, given a set of incorrect values in the data. We proceed to
describe our modeling abstractions for data, queries, and errors, and how we
use them to define the diagnosis problem.

\subsubsection*{Data and query models}

\noindent
\emph{Query log ($\mathcal{Q}$):}
We define a query log as a sequence of \texttt{UPDATE}, \texttt{INSERT}, and
\texttt{DELETE} queries queries $\mathcal{Q}=\{q_1,\dots,q_n\}$, that have
operated on a database $D$. In the rest of the paper, we use the term
\emph{update queries} to refer to any of the queries in $\mathcal(Q)$,
including insertion and deletion queries.

\smallskip
\noindent
\emph{Database state ($D_i$):}
We use $D_i$ to represent the state of a database $D$ after the application of
queries $q_1$ through $q_i$ from the log $\mathcal{Q}$. $D_0$ represents the
original database state, and $D_n$ the final, or current, database state. Out
of all the states, the system only maintains $D_0$ and $D_n$. In practice,
$D_0$ can be a checkpoint: a state of the database that we assume is correct;
we cannot diagnose errors before this state. The intermediate states can be
derived by repeating the log: $D_i=q_i(q_{i-1}(\dots q_1(D_0)))$. We also
write $D_n=\mathcal{Q}(D_0)$ to denote that the final database state $D_n$ can
be derived by applying the sequence of queries in the log to the original
database state $D_0$.

For ease of
exposition, in the remainder of the paper we assume that the database contains
a single relation, but this is not a requirement in our framework.


\subsubsection*{Error models}

\noindent
\emph{Complaint set ($\mathcal{C}$):}
We model a data error in the final database state $D_n$ as a \emph{complaint}
$c(t,t^*)$. A complaint is a pair of tuples $(t,t^*)$, such that $t\in D_n$,
and $t^*$ has the same schema as $t$, but differs in some of the values. In
the example of Figure~\ref{fig:example}, the complaint that represents the
errors in tuple $t_3$ is $c(t_3,t_3^*)$, where $t_3^*=(25,\$86000,\$21500)$.  We use complaints to model three types of errors:
\begin{description}[itemsep=0pt, parsep=0pt]
    \item[Incorrect values $c(t,t^*)$:] $t$ should be modified to $t^*$.
    \item[Missing tuples $c(\_,t^*)$:] $t^*$ should be added to $D_n$.
    \item[Present tuples $c(t,\_)$:] $t$ should be removed from $D_n$.
\end{description}
% 
We use $\mathcal{C}$ to denote the set of all known complaints, and we call it
\emph{complaint set}. Each complaint in $\mathcal{C}$ represents a
transformation (addition, deletion, or modification) of a tuple in $D_n$.
Applying all these transformations to $D_n$ results in a new database instance
$D_n^*$, and we write $D_n^*=\mathcal{C}(D_n)$. If $D_n^*$ has no remaining
data errors, we say that $\mathcal{C}$ is a \emph{complete complaint set}. 
\alex{there is some notion of minimality here...}
In our work, we do not assume that the complaint set is complete.

\smallskip
\noindent
\emph{Log repair ($\mathcal{Q}^*$):}
Our framework derives a diagnosis as a log repair
$\mathcal{Q}^*=\{q_1^*,\dots, q_n^*\}$, such that
$\mathcal{Q}^*(D_0)=\mathcal{C}(D_n)$. In this work, we assume that each query
$q_i^*$ in $\mathcal{Q}^*$ is either $q_i^*=q_i$ or $q_i^*=\mathcal{T}(q_i)$,
where $\mathcal{T}(q_i)$ is a \emph{non-structural modification} of $q_i$. A
non-structural modification $\mathcal{T}$ may change the value of the
constants that appear in a query, but it will not alter the attributes and
functions used in the query, or any of its structure. For example, a
non-structural modification of query $q_1$ in Figure~\ref{fig:example} could
be $q_1^*$=\texttt{UPDATE Taxes SET rate = 30 WHERE income >= 87500}.

\end{figure}



\subsection{Naive Formulation}

The most general version of the problem
(depicted in Figure~\ref{f:probtransform}) is to find a sequence of
transformations $T$ that insert, delete, and/or modify queries in $Q_{seq}$ 
such that the resulting sequence, $Q'_{seq} = T(Q_{seq})$, resolves the user's complaint set. 

However this problem is ill-defined because there exist an unbounded set of transformations that
can resolve the user's complaint set.  A naive solution is to append to the query log a statement
that deletes all the records in the database, followed by a query that insert all of the correct records.
Unfortunately this naive solution does not help explain the complaints in any way!

\subsection{Constraints}

For this reason, we constrain the set of possible transformations $\mathcal{T}$ to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item delete query
\item modify insert statement constants
\item modify constants in WHERE clause
\end{itemize}

Our transformations don't include adding new queries, synthesizing arbitrary queries, or modifying the
number of clauses in a WHERE condition.  We apply these restrictions because we believe it is more likely
for the user to mis-type a constant value as opposed to having an error in the query structure.

Futhermore we define a distance metric between two query logs in order to evaluate
the qulatiy of a transformation.
\xxx{define $\mathcal{T}$ here.}



\subsection{Problem Statements}

In this paper, we present three variants of this problem.

\begin{problem}[Prob-Complete]\label{prob:complete}
Given $C = P_{D_n, D^*_n}$, $Q_{seq}$, and the sequence of database states $D_0,\ldots,D_n$, 
identify a sequence of transformations $T$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $T(Q_{seq})(D_0) = C(D_n)$
\item $|T| = 1$
\item $T$ metric is minimized
\end{itemize}
\end{problem}

This variation of the problme relaxes the constraint that the complaint set must be complete, and allows
for both false positives as well as false negatives.  The goal is the same, however the constraints are relaxed:

\begin{problem}[Prob-Incomplete]\label{prob:incomplete}
Given $C$ where $acc_C < 1$, $Q_{seq}$, and the sequence of database states $D_0,\ldots,D_n$, 
identify a sequence of transformations $T$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $T(Q_{seq})(D_0) = D^*_n$
\item $T$ metric is minimized.
\item $|T| = 1$
\end{itemize}
\end{problem}

Finally, we extend the problem to allow transformations with one or more operations.

\begin{problem}[Prob-MultiQ]\label{prob:multi}
Given $C$ where $acc_C < 1$, $Q_{seq}$, and the sequence of database states $D_0,\ldots,D_n$, 
identify a sequence of transformations $T$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $T(Q_{seq})(D_0) = D^*_n$
\item $T$ metric is minimized.
\end{itemize}
\end{problem}




\subsection{A Naive Approach}

\begin{itemize}
\item roll back complaints to penultimate state using algebraic expressions 
\item perturb each expression in query until the query result matches correct state
\item if an expression cannot be found, iterate
\end{itemize}


Not clear how to roll back complaints

Ways to perturb query expressions is unbounded
