\textbf{Comment \#1:} Improvements

W1) Given that the paper considers a novel problem, I believe it could trigger
quite some follow-up work. However, to do so, I personally think that further
technical details or detailed theoretical discussion are necessary.

We clarify the soundness of the proposed optimization and conclude that
\emph{tuple-slicing} is a highly effective heuristic that greatly improved
\sys's execution efficiency and unlikely to make mistakes in practice;
\emph{attribute, query-slicing} follow attribute updating lineage and thus
guarantee the correctness.

\textbf{Comment \#2:} Additional experiments
\begin{quote}
\reviewer{
W2) I find the experimental evaluation rather preliminary and would appreciate
experiments on larger data sets or some real data set.

We improve our experimental evaluation in three ways: we first extend our
experiment with larger database sizes to up to $100k$ records in
Figure~\ref{f:attr100}; we also evaluate \sys's ability in identifying the
actual incorrect query in Appendix~\ref{app:index} and demonstrate that \sys
always fixes the actual incorrect query when the complaint set is complete; we
further study \sys's performance across different level of query interactions
and include additional experiments on query selectivity in
Appendix~\ref{app:selectivity}. Unfortunately, we are unable to get real data
set and we put such evaluation to our future work.
