\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Data-driven applications rely on the correctness of their data to function
properly and effectively. Errors in data can be incredibly costly and
disruptive, leading to loss of revenue, incorrect conclusions, and misguided
policy decisions. While data cleaning tools can purge datasets of many errors
before the data is used, applications and users interacting with the data can
introduce new errors. Subsequent valid updates can obscure these errors and
propagate them through the dataset causing more discrepancies. Even when some
of these discrepancies are discovered, they are often corrected superficially,
on a case-by-case basis, further obscuring the true underlying cause, and
making detection of the remaining errors harder.

In this paper, we propose \sys, a framework that derives explanations for
discrepancies in datasets, by analyzing the effect of queries that operated on
the data and identifying potential mistakes in those queries. \sys is
flexible, handling scenarios where only a subset of the true discrepancies is
known, and robust, tolerating incorrectly identified discrepancies gracefully.
We make four important contributions: (a) we formalize the problem of
diagnosing the causes of data errors based on the queries that operated on the
dataset; (b) we develop exact methods for deriving diagnoses and fixes for
identified errors using state-of-the-art tools; (c) we present several
performance optimizations that scale diagnosis to large datasets and query
logs, while achieving near-optimal results; (d) we develop efficient
heuristics to gracefully handle mis-identified errors. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of \sys through extensive evaluation over real-world and
synthetic data.
