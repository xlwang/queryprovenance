\section{Customize distance function}
The distance function $d(\mathcal{Q}, \mathcal{Q}^*)$ 
in Definition~\ref{def:problem} is customizable 
in different scenarios w.r.t the property of the query log and its
impact over the database. 
When the query log only involves numeric attributes, one option for 
the distance function is the Euclidean distance between variables in 
the query log $\mathcal{Q}$ and the log repair $\mathcal{Q}^*$; 
alternatively, it could be the number of 
variables that are different with the original ones. The
impact of the log repair $\mathcal{Q}^*$ can also be involved 
in the distance function: one would prefer that $\mathcal{Q}^*$
modifies as few tuples as possible, in which case the distance 
function could be the number of tuples that modified by the log repair.
By allowing this custmizable distance function, we increase the flexibility 
of our system.
