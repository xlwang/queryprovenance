\sys tackles the problem of diagnosis and repair in relational query
histories (query logs). This is in contrast to traditional data
cleaning~\cite{rahm00} which focuses on identifying and correcting
data ``in-place.'' \sys does not aim to correct errors in the data
directly, but rather to find the underlying reason for reported errors
in the queries that operated on the data.



Scorpion explanation uses data to synthesize predicates that explain.

Why not work.

View construction and query by example.

Take a look at temporal databases, the CIDR/arxiv paper has a few good starting points. Aditya also dug these out a while back


The way we return results is more like online aggregation or anytime algorithms -- 
as you run longer, the suggested fixes improve because we examine more of the query log.
