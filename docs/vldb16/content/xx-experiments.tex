% \ewu{Should say this somewhere: 
% Updates are often a small fractice of a query workload -- typically $10\%$~\cite{} in most benchmarks --
% thus in practice \sys can work for much larger workloads.  In the experiments, we filtered the workloads to 
% only look at modification queries, and specifically UPDATE queries which are hard.
% }


In this section, we carefully study the performance and accuracy
characteristics of the naive MILP-based repair algorithm, as well as 
slicing-based optimizations that improve the latency of the system
, and an incremental algorithm for single query corruptions that
further improves the latency. 
%and 
%the multi-pass tuple-slicing algorithm that tolerates incomplete complaint sets with minimal loss in accuracy.
Our goals in the evaluation is to understand these trade-offs in
controlled synthetic scenarios, as well as study the effectiveness
in typical database query workloads based on widely used benchmarks.

To this end, our experiments are organized as follows: First, 
we compare the naive and incremental MILP algorithm against the different optimizations 
to highlight the value of different optimizations.  We then compare the
repair costs of \texttt{INSERT}, \texttt{DELETE}, or \texttt{UPDATE}-only query logs 
and find that the latter query type is by far the most complicated and costly to repair.
For the subsequent experiments, we focus solely on \texttt{UPDATE}-only synthetic workloads 
to understand how \sys responds to different query logs and databases.  
We further evaluate the efficacy on real-world databases transaction benchmarks,
TPC-C and TATP. Finally, we evaluate \sys on a series of query logs with different properties. 
All experiments were run on 12x2.66 GHz  machines with 16GB RAM running CentOS release 6.6.



% establish the quality limitations of existing heuristics and the need for a formal, 
% constraint-based algorithm (\exact).  Second, we study how each of the 
% optimizations described in Section~\ref{s:optimiztaions} improves algorithm scalability.
% Third, we introduce different forms of error in the input complaint sets and study the 
% effectiveness of our noise-handling heuristics.

Each of our experiments follows a consistent procedure. 
We generate a sequence of queries using a synthetic query generator or 
the benchmark program, and corrupt the query log as described below. 
We then execute the original and corrupt query logs on an initial (possibly empty) database,
and perform a tuple-wise comparison between the resulting database states 
to generate a true complaint set.  
We then add noise to the complaint set by removing true complaints to simulate false negatives.
Finally, we execute the evaluated algorithms on the complaints and compare the fixed
query log with the true query log, as well as the fixed and true
final database states to measure performance and accuracy metrics.
\iffalse
We compare the following algorithms: 
\xlw{$\sys_{S \subseteq \{t,q,a,inc-x\}}$, where $S$ 
defines the set of optimizations present in the algorithm: 
the subscripts $t,q,a$ represent the
application of tuple, query and attribute slicing optimizations and $inc-x$ represents 
the incremental query repairs with step size {\it x}.
For example, $\sys_{tq,inc-1}$ uses both tuple and query slicing along with incremental repair with step size 1.}
\xlw{I removed the stop early and search all description here. Could be added later, current updated experiment do not contain results for this. }
\fi
We evaluate the algorithms along several metrics.  Performance is measured as wall clock
time between submitting a query log and the system terminating after retrieving a valid repair.  
We also measure the repair's precision (percentage of repaired tuples that were correctly fixed), 
the recall (the percentage of the full complaint set that was repaired), 
and the F1 measure (the harmonic mean of precision and recall).
Our reported metrics are the average across multiple runs.
%Finally, Table~\ref{t:params} summarizes the key parameters that we vary throughout our experiments.  
We describe the experimental parameters in the context of the datasets and workloads below.

\subsubsection{Datasets and Workloads}

This subsection describes the query and data generation process in greater detail.

\stitle{Synthetic:} \label{sec:syntheticgen}
We generate an initial database of $N_D$ random tuples.  
The schema contains $N_a=10$ attributes $a_1\ldots a_{10}$, whose values are
picked from $V_d$ uniformly at random, along with a primary key $id$.
We then generate a sequence of $N_q$ \texttt{UPDATE} queries~\footnote{\scriptsize We focus on
\texttt{UPDATE} only query logs because they are the {\it predominant} cost 
in a query log.  Experiment~\ref{sec:indelup} compares \texttt{INSERT}, \texttt{DELETE} and \texttt{UPDATE}
only workloads to illustrate the differenc.} where 
\verb|?| is a randomly generated value and \verb|r| is the size of the range predicate: 
{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
  UPDATE SET X,.. WHERE Y ...
  X = Constant: SET (a_i = ?),..
  X = Relative: SET (a_i = a_i + ?)
  Y = Point: WHERE a_j = ? AND ...
  Y = Range: WHERE a_j in [?, ?+r] AND ...
\end{verbatim}
}

$X \& Y$ represents the \texttt{UPDATE} query type. $X$ represents the set clause type which can be either constant update ($Constant$) or
relative update ($Relative$). Similarly, $Y$ represents the where clause type that can be either point update ($Point$) or
range update ($Range$). Note that the 
we default focus on \texttt{UPDATE} queries with non-key predicates on range(s) and constant SET clauses.

The \texttt{SET} clause sets the attribute to a random constant value in $V_d$ and 
the \texttt{WHERE} clauses form a conjunction.  
% The $set$ parameter controls whether the \texttt{UPDATE} queries set attributes to random constant values ({\it const}),  
% or relative values ({\it rel}) by incrementing by a random, possibly negative, value.  
In addition, the skew parameter $s$ determines the distribution attributes referenced in the \texttt{WHERE} and \texttt{SET} clauses.  
Each attribute in a query is picked from either a uniform distribution when $s=0$ or a zipfian distribution.
This allows our experiments to vary between a uniform distribution, where each attribute is
equally likely to be picked, and a skewed distribution where nearly all attributes are the same. \\
The \texttt{WHERE} clauses in \texttt{DELETE} queries are generated in an identical fashion, while
\texttt{INSERT} queries insert values picked uniformly at random from $V_d$.

\stitle{TPC-C:} We use the data and query workload over the {\it ORDER} table in TPC-C~\cite{tpcc}.  
We generated a database at scale 1 with one warehouse, and kept the queries that modify the
{\it ORDER} table. The initial table contains 6000 tuples and we ultimately generated a log with
2000 queries, where $1837$ are \texttt{INSERT}s and the rest are \texttt{UPDATE}s. 

\stitle{TATP:} TATP workload simulates the 
caller location system. We generate a database from {\it SUBSCRIBER} table
with 5000 tuples and $2000$ \texttt{UPDATE} queries.\\
Both TPC-C and TATP setups were generated using the OLTP-bench project~\cite{difallah2013oltp}. 
We corrupt up to 1500 queries ahead of the most recent query.  



\stitle{Corrupting Queries:} We corrupt query $q_i$ by replacing it with a randomly
generated query of the same type based on the procedures described above.
To standardize our procedures, we selected a fixed set of indexes $idx$
that are used in all experiments.  
%Appendix~\ref{app:qidx} presents
%experiments that justify the rationale behind our selection.

\subsection{Preliminaries}
The following set of experiments are designed to establish the rationale for 
our experimental settings in the subsequent experiments.  
Specifically, we compare different slicing-based optimizations of the naive approach
as the number of queries increases.  
We then evaluate the scalability of the different slicing-based optimizations of the 
incremental approach in the context of a single
corrupted query. We then establish the difficulty of repairing \texttt{UPDATE} 
workloads as compared to other query types. We observed that among all types of 
optimizations, tuple-slicing is needed for accuracy in addition to helping performance
under different scenarios.


\stitle{Multiple Corrupt Queries:}
In this experiment, we compare the naive algorithm (no-opt) against 
each slicing optimization individually($tuple, attr, query$) and all of them together ($all$).  
We use the default settings with $N_D = 1000$ tuples and a sequence of \texttt{update} queries.
We generate query logs in 5 different sizes $N_q = \{10, 20, 30, 40, 50\}$ and corrupt 
every tenth query starting from oldest query $q_0$,
up to $q_{40}$.  For example, when the $N_q = {30}$, we corrupt 3 queries: $q_{0,10,20}$. 
We find that the number of queries greatly affects both the scalabality (Figure~\ref{f:multi_time}) 
and the accuracy (Figure~\ref{f:multi_acc}) of the algorithms. Specifically, as the number increases,
the number of possible assignments of the MILP parameters increases exponentially and the solver often takes
longer than our experimental time limit of $1000$ seconds and returns an infeasibility error.  
This is a predominant reason why the accuracy degrades past $30$ queries.  For example, 
when $40$ queries are involved (with $4$ corruptions) 
and we ignore the infeasible executions, the average execution time is $300$ seconds
and the precision and recall are greater than $0.94$.  Unfortunately, with $50$ queries ($5$ corruptions),
all runs exceed the time limit.

\stitle{Single Query Optimization:}
In this experiment, we evaluate the efficacy \sys with tuple slicing and incremental optimization
in the special case when only one query has been corrupted. We compare 
incremental without tuple slicing ($no-opt$) against with tuple slicing at 
different batching levels of 1, 2, 8 ($1,2,8$). 
Figure~\ref{f:singlequeryinc_time} highlights the scalability limitation of the incremental 
algorithm without tuple slicing: with 50 queries $no-opt$ could easily runs exceed the 1000 seconds.   
In addition, Figure~\ref{f:singlequeryinc_acc} also shows a significant drop in accuracy as we increase the incremental level from $1$ 
to $2$ as the failure rate of the MILP problem is positive proportional to the incremental batch level.


\stitle{Query Type Experiment:}\label{sec:indelup}
Our final preliminary experiment evaluates 
$\sys$ (incremental, tuple-slicing) on \texttt{INSERT}, \texttt{DELETE}, or \texttt{UPDATE}-only workloads.
We increase the number of queries from $1$ to $200$ and corrupt the oldest query in the log.  
Figure~\ref{f:indelup_time} shows that while the cost of repairing insert workloads
remains relatively constaint, the cost for delete-only and update-only workloads increase as 
the corruption happen earlier in the query log while update-only increase much faster than delete-only.
\sys shows near perfect accuracy (precision and recall) for all settings (Figure~\ref{f:indelup_acc}).


{\it Takeaways: we find that the non-incremental \sys algorithms, even when using the optimizations,
have severe scalability limitations due to the large number of undetermined values -- this is not surprising
since MILP constraint solving is a known NP-hard problem.
In contrast, we find that the incremental algorithms are more effective at scaling to larger query log sizes.  
Furthermore, we show that \texttt{UPDATE}-only workloads are significantly more expensive to repair than other 
query types. Based on the result, we consider incremental
algorithm $\sys$ with tuple slicing as default setting in the rest of the experiment and we only consider \texttt{UPDATE}-only workload in synthetic experiments in Section~\ref{sec:experiments:synth}.

\subsection{Benchmark}
\label{sec:experiments:benchmark}

Figure~\ref{f:tpcctatp} plots the performance of the incremental and optimized algorithm ($\sys$)
on TPC-C and TATP benchmark applications.  In both workloads, the latency to derive a repair efficiently,
and for TPC-C, on the order of milliseconds where all corrupted queries are \texttt{INSERT}s. 
The precision and recall measures were
$1$ both all settings.   One reason for the good performance is due to the fact that the benchmark queries
are pre-dominantly point insert or update queries.  In this setting, each tuples affects a very small set of 
tuples, which results in $1$ or $2$ complaints on average.  In this case, the tuple and query slicing algorithms
reduce the total number of constraints for almost every setting to less than $100$.


{\it Takeaway: many workloads in practice are dominated by point update queries.  In these settings,
 \sys is very effective at reducing the number of constraints and can derive repairs in nearly
 interactive latencies.}

\subsection{Synthetic Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments:synth}
In this section, we conduct a series of experiments evaluating the performance of \sys. 
We divide these experiments into four groups: comparison on slicing-based optimizations;  
performance of \sys with different scalability; performance of \sys with different
query log skew factor; and performance of \sys in handling false negative noise. 
Note that we will not show the accuracy figures for experiments with above $99\%$
F1-score and the default query in synthetic dataset is 
\texttt{UPDATE} query with \textit{Constant} set clause and
\textit{Range} where clause.

\stitle{\sys Optimizations - Attribute Size:}
We first evaluate \sys and its optimizations by increasing the number of attribute ($N_a$)
in the table from $10$ to $50, 100, 500$ with $N_D = 100$. As shown 
in Figure~\ref{f:attr}, when the number of attribute in a table is small, e.g., 10, 
performance of \sys with or without query slicing or attribute slicing optiomizations 
appears identical. However, as we gradually increase the number of attribute, the benefit
of query slicing or attribute slicing become much more significant. 
In particular, \sys with all slicing-based optimizations ($all$) is $40$ times faster than \sys with only tuple-slicing 
optimization ($tuple only$) when there are 500 attribute in the table.  

\stitle{\sys Optimizations - Database Size:}
We further evaluate the performance of \sys by increasing the database size ($N_D$) from
$100$ to $500, 1k, 5k$ while keep $N_a = 100$. As shown in Figure~\ref{f:attr100}, \sys with all optimizations 
($all$) shows constant percentage of gain as the database size increases. 

\smallskip

In the following set of synthetic experiments, we individually vary scalability factors(
the query complexity (set/where clause type, \# of where clauses), log size $N_q$, database size $N_D$) and skewness 
factor in 
order by to tease apart the parameters that most affect our metrics.
Motivated by our preliminary results, we focus on \texttt{UPDATE}-only query logs with a single corruption with
$10$ attributes and $1k$ attributes in the table. As the performance of \sys with different optimizations appears 
identical when $N_a = 10$, we will only show results of \sys with tuple slicing optimization in the rest of the 
experiments.

\stitle{Scalability - Log Size:}
Figures~\ref{f:logsize_time} and~\ref{f:logsize_acc} increase the query log size (each subplot) between $50, 100, 500$ and $1000$.
We compared the baseline $\sys_{t,inc}^{1st}$ with addition attribute, query or both slicing optimizations.
For readibility purposes, we have normalized the x-axis to show the distance of the corrupted query from the most recent query in the log
(e.g., $x=50$ denotes that $q_{N-50}$ was corrupted).
As expectied, the cost increases as the corruption is older in the query log since more queries need to be tested before the
true corruption is encountered.  There algorithms all execute at roughly the same performance, though there is a slight advantage to
using the query-slicing optimization. The optimization reduces the time to linearize the query log by roughly $20\%$, however
the CPLEX solver time contributes to over half the total time so the improvement is difficult to see.
All algorithms exhibit near perfect F1-scores.
\fi


\stitle{Scalability - DB Size:}
Figures~\ref{f:dbsize_time} vary the database size from $100$ to $100$k tuples while setting the other parameters to their default settings.
For simplicity, we plot the performance and accuracy of corruptions at two query indexes: $50$ and $200$.
The more recent corruption ($200$) is executed in nearly constant time as the database size increases, with a perfect F1-score.
In contrast, the older corruption increases in cost as the database size increases.  One reason is because as the database size increases, the
number of complaints also increases.  We have found that the performance of the solver in dependent on the number of complaints (which
increases the size of the MILP problem).  This is verified by the fact that the number of constraints and variables increase linearly with the database size, which further affect the solving cost.

\stitle {Scalability - Query Complexity (update type): }
Figure~\ref{f:qidx_time} compares the performance of \sys in solving three types \texttt{UPDATE}-only workloads: {\it Constant/Point, Constant/Range, Relative/Range} while increase the number of queries \sys need to solve from $1$ to $250$ (by adjusting the corrupt query index). We found that \sys solves \texttt{UPDATE} with point predicates is easier to solve than range predicates and constant update is 
easier to solve than relative update because of two reasons: 1. constraints we constructed for the constant update are simpler than relative update due to the set clause structure; 2. the size of complaints in constant updates is oftentimes smaller than relative updates as the affected tuples always expands in the latter case. 

\stitle{Scalability - Query Complexity (where clause size):}
Our final scalability experiment (Figures~\ref{f:where_time})
varies the complexity of the update queries by increasing the number of predicates in the \texttt{WHERE} clause, 
while keeping the overall selectivity constant. In addition, we force the complaint set size within the same range for each corrupt query index. From Figure~\ref{f:where_time}, we found that larger predicate size increases the cost in solving a problem. This is expected as when there are more predicates, the number of constraints and variables in the MILP problem also increase, which further increase the problem complexity.
%We find that the performance improves as the number of predicates increases.
%This counter-intuitive result is due to the reduction in the complaint set size as the complexity increases. 
%Again, we omit the accuracy result as \sys exhibit above 0.996 average F1 score in all settings. 


\stitle{Skew:} We now study the effects of attribute skew on the algorithms.
We vary the skew parameter from $0$ (uniform) to $1e-7, 0.5, 1$. When $s=1$, nearly every attribute is on $A_0$.
Different skewness factors change the dependencies of queries in the log and the dependencies of queries further affects the cost in solving the problem: higher query dependency helps pruning the searching space and thus makes the problem easier to solve. High query dependency could be achieved by increasing the skewness factor and the number of queries from most recent to the corrupted query, thus
we observe a clear decreasing trend in Figure~\ref{f:skew_time} as we increase the skewness factor on corrupt index equals to $50$. However, when the corruption happen more recent (corrupt index equals to $200$), this trend can be hardly seen.

% Our hypothesis is that higher skew results in a larger number of relevant queries, thus limiting the effectiveness of query slicing.
% In addition, recall that each query sets all tuples within the same range to the same value.  
% Since increasing the skew makes it more likely that both the \texttt{SET} and \texttt{WHERE} clauses reference the same attributes,
% it causes the tuples to cluster around the values, thus increasing the selectivity of the queries.
% This results in a larger complaint set, which

% We generate query log at 4 different skewness levels from uniform to 
% super skewed with $s = 0, 1e-7, 0.5, 1$. As we can see as query log
% is more skewed, the execution time for solving same amount of queries 
% increase. This is also due to the fact that increasing skewness also
% increase the query dependency, which, in turn, increase the searching
% space in the MILP problem.


\stitle{Incomplete Complaint Sets:}
Our final experiment (Figures~\ref{f:falsenegative_time} and~\ref{f:falsenegative_acc}) evaluates the fase positive rate in incomplete complaint sets.
We increase the rate from $0$, meaning $0\%$ missing in the complaint set to .75, where $75\%$ are missing.  
We find that reducing the size of the submitted complaint set naturally improves the repair performance,
however the repair quality, both precision and recall in Figure~\ref{f:falsenegative_acc}, may suffer if the corruption occured in a very old query.

\textit{Takeaways: we find that the performance of the different repair algorithm 
heavily depends on the property of the property of the datasets and the 
number of complaints in the complaint set. Attribute and query slicing show significant gain for 
datasets with large number of attributes. And the proposed \sys algorithm is able to solve hard problems
(with ~$200$ \texttt{UPDATE} queries) in reasonable amount of time. }
